Once you added the students to your class, you can create: a meeting to communicate with them, a real-time board to draw on, which feels like teaching in your  school's classroom, a real-time document that is saved for later and where you can write the important things.  In the class, you can also create assignments for your students and correct their uploaded homework.`,
